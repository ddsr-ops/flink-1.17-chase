        /* Typically, you only need to use getExecutionEnvironment(), since this will do the right thing depending on
         the context: if you are executing your program inside an IDE or as a regular Java program it will create a
         local environment that will execute your program on your local machine. If you created a JAR file from your
         program, and invoke it through the command line, the Flink cluster manager will execute your main method and
          getExecutionEnvironment() will return an execution environment for executing your program on a cluster. */

        // If you donâ€™t want to wait for the job to finish, you can trigger asynchronous job execution by calling
        // executeAsync() on the StreamExecutionEnvironment. It will return a JobClient with which you can
        // communicate with the job you just submitted. For instance, here is how to implement the semantics of
        // execute() by using executeAsync().
        final JobClient jobClient = env.executeAsync();
